Basic techniques and examples of deep learning

- TrainTechniques_activation_schedule_dataAug: several activation function (leaky relu, prelu, elu, selu), use pretrained model, scheduling, regularization, data augmentation, Example with cifar-10 (use subclassing).

- Basic_mnist_subclass_manualTrain: examples of subclassing and manual training (i.e. run the training loop that computes gradients and apply gradient descent), use MNIST.

- PreprocessingPipeline_flower: example of constructing a data preprocessing pipeline using Tensorflow (including shuffle, batch, prefetch, caching), use flower dataset.

- HyperparamTuning: example of using keras hyperparameter tuning with cifar-10.

- Visualization_tensorboard_lime: visualize training with Tensorboard, example of using LIME to gain insight into the model's working by looking at the region in the image that is important.
