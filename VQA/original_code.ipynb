    "# A4: Visual Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you'll gain experience working with multi-input models. You'll develop a model that takes a question and an image as input, and returns a yes/no answer in response. You'll also gain experience working with (and preprocessing) large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to implement your model using either Model Subclassing or the Functional API. I suggest using the Functional API - it's worth gaining experience with, so you're familiar with it if you see it in code examples down the road. In either case, you will likely spend more time preparing and preprocessing the dataset, than you will developing the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your starter dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The [VQA dataset](https://visualqa.org/download.html) includes images and JSON containing the questions and answers. To save you time parsing the JSON (and various other preprocessing work), I've prepared a subset of the dataset in an easier to read CSV file. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should download your starter dataset from [here](https://storage.cloud.google.com/applied-dl/mini-vqa/starter2.csv). \n",
    "\n",
    "Your starter CSV has three columns, giving the question, answer, and image.\n",
    "\n",
    "question|answer|image\n",
    ":-----:|:-----:|:-----:\n",
    "is the sky blue|yes|COCO\\_train2014\\_000000393221.jpg\n",
    "is there snow on the mountains|yes|COCO\\_train2014\\_000000393221.jpg\n",
    "is the window open|no|COCO\\_train2014\\_000000393223.jpg\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes on how this was prepared.\n",
    "* The starter dataset contains all the \"yes\" / \"no\" questions from the VQA v2 training annotations. \n",
    "* The answers are the most frequent one to the question (ties broken randomly). \n",
    "* The text has been cleaned (lowercased, punctuation removed). \n",
    "* Each image and question is used exactly once.\n",
    "* There are 140,637 questions, and 42,985 images.\n",
    "* The image filenames correspond to the [COCO 2014 training images](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2014.zip). Note this file is about 11GB. You will need to download this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on downloading the COCO training images\n",
    "\n",
    "The training images are large, and you may not want to download them repeatedly in Colab (e.g., if your instance resets, you will not want to have to download and preprocess an 11GB file all over again). Continue reading this assignment for tips.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, your workflow for this assignment will be to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1: \n",
    "- Create a notebook called \"preprocessing.ipynb\". In this notebook:\n",
    "- Download the training images.\n",
    "- Preprocess the images referenced in the starter CSV (e.g. by resizing them to 299x299). The starter CSV uses only a small fraction of the total images in the COCO dataset. You can disgard the unused images (e.g., by deleting them to free up disk space). \n",
    "- Create a zip file containing only the preprocessed images from the starter dataset (it should be about 500MB) and upload that to web.\n",
    "- To upload a zip on the web, you can use any Cloud service (for example, [Cloud storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets)). Do not pay for a Cloud solution for this class (GCP, for example, has a free tier you can use).\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2:\n",
    "- Complete this notebook, following the instrutions below.\n",
    "- In this notebook, download your 500MB zip containing the preprocessed training images you created above using a command like ```!wget```, or the code shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on creating and training your model\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find an example VQA model at the bottom of this [guide](https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide/). Note: you should start with a smaller model (in terms of vocabulary size,sequence length, and other parameters). \n",
    "\n",
    "Other changes: \n",
    "* Instead of training a CNN from scratch, you will use a pretrained model (Inception-V3) and cache activations to disk. \n",
    "* Your model will take a while to train. It is important that you save a [checkpoint](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/save_and_serialize) to disk after each epoch (or every several epochs). Before training your model, check for existing checkpoints, and load the latest one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When developing a complex model, it is important to fit on a single batch first (repeatedly train on the same batch of 32 examples and labels). Verify your model can successfully memorize this data (the loss should go to zero). For tips, see this excellent blog post: [A recipe for training NNs](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next, write code to make predictions on each of these images, and to display the image, question, and answer. Make sure the results are sensible. \n",
    "\n",
    "* As always, start with a simple model, get that working end-to-end, then gradually scale up.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code defensively and get to know your data. There will be several preprocessing steps (resizing images, caching actiations, tokenization, padding, etc). After each one, write a short block of code to verify the output is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starter code\n",
    "\n",
    "The starter code below contains various blocks you can use for your two notebooks (the first to download and preprocess the data, the second to train your model).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Please submit this assignment on CourseWorks by uploading a zip containing your preprocessing notebook, and this file (both should include saved output)."
